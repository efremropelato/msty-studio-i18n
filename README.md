# Msty Internationalization (i18n)

Welcome to the **Msty Internationalization Repository**! This repository enables the global community to contribute translations for the Msty app, making it accessible to users around the world. 🌍

## Repository Structure

The root of this repository contains an `i18n` directory, which includes the following:

- **`locales` directory**: This is where all language files are stored. Each language has its own JSON file (e.g., `en_US.json`, `es_ES.json`).

### Example Structure
```
i18n/
└── locales/
    ├── en_US.json   // American English strings (maintained by the Msty team)
    ├── en_GB.json   // British / International English strings (community contribution)
    ├── es_ES.json   // Spanish strings (community contribution)
    ├── fr_FR.json   // French strings (community contribution)
    └── ...          // Add other language files here
```

## Contributing Translations

### 1. Locate `en_US.json`
The `en_US.json` file is the primary source of truth for all text in Msty. It is maintained by the Msty development team.

### 2. Copy and Translate
1. Copy the `en_US.json` file and save it with the appropriate language code (e.g., `de_DE.json` for German, `zh_CN.json` for Simplified Chinese).
2. Translate the strings in the new file while maintaining the same structure as `en_US.json`.

### 3. Submit Your Translation
Once your translation is complete:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your new language file under `i18n/locales/`.
3. Create a pull request for review.


## Guidelines for Translations

- **Preserve JSON Structure**: The structure of your translated file must exactly match `en_US.json`.
- **Maintain Accuracy**: Ensure translations are as accurate and contextually relevant as possible.
- **Use UTF-8 Encoding**: JSON files should use UTF-8 encoding to support all characters.

## Nuxt i18n and Vue i18n

Msty leverages [Nuxt i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) and [Vue i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) for internationalization. While users don't need to know these specifics to contribute, the links are provided for reference.

## Ownership and Usage
